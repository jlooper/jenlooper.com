description: The Grad Project has allowed us to meet graduate students and learn about how they use AWS technologies to further their research goals and accomplish their projects. Stay tuned as we learn from them in person on LinkedIn Live in a series of two hands-on workshops available to be run by attendees, live, on SageMaker Studio Labs.
