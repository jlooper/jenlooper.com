            <h2>Computer Science for Kids: A Storytelling Approach</h2>
            <p class="text-2xl">
              Aligned for grades 6-8, this textbook is for sale on Amazon and at a bookstore near you. It's a rethinking of the Middle School Computer Science curriculum and includes a web site and GitHub code in a project-based, storytelling-infused format. Watch for the 'hidden curriculum' featuring sustainability!
