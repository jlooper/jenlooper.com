            <p class="text-2xl">         
              Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I have over 25 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating creative cross-platform apps, often with an educational focus. I design excellent curriculum on technical topics and am known for the quality of my educational content, my managerial skills, and my creative strategies.

          <p class="text-2xl">I'm a multilingual multiculturalist with a passion for hardware hacking, mobile apps, the frontend of the web and various JavaScript frameworks and meta-frameworks, applied machine learning and AI (as well as the ramifications!) and discovering new things every day. On occasion I can be found teaching front-end technology at Boston University's Metropolitan College. I'm also on the Fulbright Specialists roster, just waiting for that right opportunity to help a community.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">I've worked as Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS, a Principal Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft, a Developer Advocate at Progress/Telerik. I've also worked at small, medium, and large companies over my career.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">I wrote a textbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Kids-Storytelling-Approach/dp/1119912512/" target="_blank">Computer Science for Kids: A Storytelling Approach</a> for grades 6-8, aligned to CSTA standards. Learn more at <a href="https://cs4kids.club" target="_blank">CS4Kids.club</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">I also wrote The Illustrated AWS Cloud, a visual guide to learning fundamental concepts of cloud computing with AWS. Learn more at <a href="https://illustratedaws.cloud" target="_blank">The Illustrated AWS Cloud website</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">In 2018 I founded what became an international nonprofit organization, Front-End Foxes, Inc. Our mission was to educate women worldwide in front-end web and mobile technologies. During the pandemic we pivoted to become a free bootcamp for women. I'm very proud of what we accomplished over five years.</p>

        <h2>AI Usage Policy</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl">I use AI-powered code editors such as Copilot on occasion to learn a new framework such as next.js or to help refactor code to improve a piece of software I'm working on. It's a very useful way to upgrade old codebases, as I demonstrated <a href="https://community.aws/content/2oK6iLrwI2onKceVenHeyxYGBkQ/snappy-squirrel-rides-again-with-amazon-q-and-phaser-a-refactoring-success">here</a>. However, I do not use AI to write blogposts or newsletter articles. I have used AI art generators such as Midjourney, enhanced in Canva, to build header images, and cite the usage. I don't subscribe to Midjourney and don't generate novel images there, but look at images others have created and use them to create amusing images on occasion for article headers, especially for my (currently dormant) newsletter on LinkedIn.</p>
