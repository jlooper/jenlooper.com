              Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I have over 24 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating creative cross-platform apps, often with an educational focus. I design excellent curriculum on technical topics and am known for the quality of my educational content.

          <p class="text-2xl">I've worked as Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS, a Principal Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft, a Developer Advocate at Progress/Telerik, a noprofit founder and CEO at Front-End Foxes, Inc., a lecturer in CS at Boston University's Metropolitan College, and other small, medium, and large companies over my career.</p>
          
          <p class="text-2xl">I'm a multilingual multiculturalist with a passion for hardware hacking, mobile apps, the frontend of the web and various JavaScript frameworks and meta-frameworks, applied machine learning and AI (as well as the ramifications!) and discovering new things every day. On occasion I can be found teaching front-end technology at Boston University's Metropolitan College. I'm also on the Fulbright Specialists roster, just waiting for that right opportunity to help a community.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">I'm also an author of a textbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Kids-Storytelling-Approach/dp/1119912512/" target="_blank">Computer Science for Kids: A Storytelling Approach</a> for grades 6-8, aligned to CSTA standards. Learn more about this textbook at <a href="https://cs4kids.club" target="_blank">CS4Kids.club</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">I also wrote The Illustrated AWS Cloud, also with Wiley, a visual guide to learning fundamental concepts of Cloud computing with AWS. Learn more at <a href="https://illustratedaws.cloud" target="_blank">The Illustrated AWS Cloud web site</a>.</p>
          <p class="text-2xl">In 2018 I founded what became an international nonprofit organization, Front-End Foxes, Inc. Our mission was to educate women worldwide in front-end web and mobile technologies. During the pandemic we pivoted to become a free bootcamp for women. I'm very proud of what we accomplished over five years.</p>
