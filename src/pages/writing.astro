      <p class="text-2xl">
        Welcome! I'm Jen Looper. I have over 24 years' experience as a web and
        mobile developer, specializing in creating cross-platform apps, often
        with an educational focus. I design excellent curriculum on technical
        topics and am known for the quality of my educational content.

        I'm a multilingual multiculturalist with a passion for hardware hacking,
        mobile apps, the frontend of the web and various JavaScript frameworks
        and meta-frameworks, applied machine learning and AI (as well as the
        ramifications!) and discovering new things every day.

        I'm also an author of a textbook, <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Kids-Storytelling-Approach/dp/1119912512/"

        In 2018 I founded what became an international nonprofit organization,
        Front-End Foxes, Inc. Our mission was to educate women worldwide in
        front-end web and mobile technologies. During the pandemic we pivoted to
        become a free bootcamp for women. I'm very proud of what we accomplished
        over five years.
